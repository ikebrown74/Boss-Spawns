  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p class="text-success"><strong>UPDATE: I am currently working on the site design. Feel free to bug prawn.9728 with your thoughts.</strong></p>
  <p>Mobile version coming soon! Also countdowns have been added for each boss that has a submitted death time.</p>
  <p>Thanks for using GW2 Spawns as your reliable boss timer! The countdowns and spawn times are all depending on user submissions, and votes, so please just alt + tab over and submit a death when you kill a dude. Each death time is credited to your user account, so you get some internet cred if that's your thing.</p>

  <p>Boss Spawns IS open source! Feel free to check out the git repository and add send me a pull request.</p>
